# Coloured-Discord-Themes
Some themes focused in one color each.

Regarding Compact Version:
Compact themes must be setup in the file, just paste some links in the right places and enjoy(All you need to start is there).
Compact Themes are Updated "Automatically" once i upload the update so if something's wrong it should get fixed shortly... but if you want you can contact me to request a fixing update @Waterin#6451


Regarding Source Version:
Source need to be downloaded again to update the file so Compact version is recommended unless you want to edit source on your own!

Regarding animations:
The animations can only be disabled on Source by taking @ that's before "keyframes".


Support and Contact:
Any help needed pls contact me through discord @Waterin#6451

Feel free to suggest and request colors. I'll try to implement if it is really good. ^^
