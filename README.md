# Coloured-Discord-Themes
Some themes focused in one color each.

Compact-Version: Will get updates and fixes without having to redownload.

User-Friendly Version (Compact) was updated just pick the theme you want and if you want a different background follow the instructions in the file.

Regarding Source Version: Source need to be downloaded again to update the file so Compact version is recommended unless you want to edit source on your own!

Regarding animations: The animations can only be disabled on Source by taking @ that's before "keyframes".

Support and Contact: Any help needed pls contact me through discord @Waterin#6451

Feel free to suggest and request colors. I'll try to implement if it is really good. ^^
